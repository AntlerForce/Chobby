"To each its own"
 
This polity seems to have started as a defensive alliance, as the old empire was falling apart. Many systems in the region had long-suppressed desires for independence, and banded together to maintain a semblance in the slow disappearance of imperial law. With time, trade and law enforcement agreements completed the military treaties, and the Union slowly became a political entity in its own right, if a very decentralized one constituted of very autonomous members.
 
As it grew in size and strength, it also started to run into rivals, both over strategic places and ideology. This drove them to create an unified military and foreign service, with the occasional bout of expansionism.
It seems to have fared relatively well, until they were were faced with a much stronger enemy against whom they started to loose system after system.
With the enemy at the gates of their core worlds, there was little hope of repelling them without of a miracle - instead of what, everyone disappeared.]]

The origin of this new Restoration is unclear. They claim that as the previous empire disintegrated, it retained its traditions and a core of systems, from which it started to rebuild and reassert itself and. They based the legitimacy of their grand conquest by turning it into a reclamation of its rightful place as the sole ruler of the galaxy. As such, it is unsurprising that their enemies would have less flattering histories, the most popular being that an ambitious warlord conquered the fallen empire's homeworlds before having delusions of grandeur.
 
Whatever the truth is, they did retain many of the traditions of the previous empire, and initially based their legal system and political organization on it. By the force of arms, they managed to slowly but surely conquer the galaxy again, with more and more resources and autonomy given to their formidable military machine. In the end, there were only a few factions still resisting them, with little hope of repelling their armies.
However, with so much of the empire's efforts being diverted toward the armies, it appears to have been growing unrest on many conquered worlds across the galaxy.]]

Unrest was steadily growing across the Empire, both on wealthy peripheral worlds and poor, isolated ones, mostly from the resources and attention diverted towards their war machine, and the rule of law becoming both harsher and less effective at keeping order. The Empire thought they could hold enough authority to prevent any serious challenge to their rule, at least for long enough to finish pacifying the galaxy. It appears they were wrong.
Several uprisings started on varied worlds in a large portion of the Empire. Unprepared to such a large rebellion, faced with an enemy relying more on subversion and deception than military control of territory, it quickly lost control of entire regions. The Empire was prompt to turn its war machine inward and crush the rebellion by the force of arms, as daunting a task as it was.
 
The goal of the Rebels was not direct victory so much as mortally injuring the Empire from the inside, and holding long enough to survive it. What plans did they have for the aftermath is unclear, given how many disparate groups participated. However, for such coordinated uprisings to take place, a central organization had to be overseeing it. Was it an ad-hoc coalition of mutually hostile forces against a greater common enemy, or did they have their own agenda?]]

As the previous galactic order fell apart, many long-repressed sectarian tensions flared, particularly between free machines and biosupremacists. As conflicts increased in violence, a self-defense group of free machines carved a safe-haven for themselves, before harboring more endangered groups and allying with other self-defense groups as time went by and the whole region slid into anarchy.
During the interregnum, they slowly grew up in territory and influence, until they became a regional hegemon. This put them in rivalry with the Union over both strategic and ideological points, having become a highly centralized, harmonist regime. This cold war marred by proxy conflicts was only ended by the greater threat of the Empire.
 
Realizing that even their uneasy alliance with the Union would not be enough to repel the Empire, they threw every resource they had on the defensive effort, hoping to either outlast the Empire, or maybe find another avenue to victory entirely.
At the time of the event, they were slowly loosing ground, holding onto strategic points with all their strength and making the Empire pay a surprisingly heavy toll for each conquered world. Given their tight organization, formidable defenses and the series of strategic choke-points that were their last worlds, they may have held for a very long time.]]

As it turns out, it appears that the Dynasty was behind it all. The oldest known organization in the galaxy, they were thought to have been destroyed by the Anarchai at the fall of Chatka, millennia before. Somehow, they appear to have survived.
 
Tracing back to Earth, they were a shadowy group of biosupremacists, obsessed with creating superior humans through genetic and biological modifications, and ruling over humanity as its greatest representatives. They shunned cybernetic enhancements, and hated non-human synths and free machines as anathema. They were divided into rival families, united only in their goal and against common menaces.
They only acted in broad daylight when they were certain of their strength, preferring to subvert those they could, and secretly organizing rebellions against those they couldn't. They were the one behind the Rebels, hoping to destabilize the Empire and take over in the resulting chaos. Even if the Empire won, it would have been weakened enough for them to grow their influence - assuming they would not have been discovered.

Taken aback, the Celestial Dominion, Ghost Mandate and Dynasty put their longstanding cold war on hold to band together against this new menace, but to no avail.

Fortunately, there is no programming for interplanetary or interstellar contamination, even when space-capable hardware is infected - which often degrades too fast to be capable of reaching other worlds in any cases, so quarantine is effective as containment method.
 
However, reclaiming contaminated worlds is extremely difficult, as those are much more resilient than any nanite should be able to.

This was the homeworld of the new Dynasty. Even after centuries, they were still but children, compared to their legendary forebears - but they were driven by the same fire. Obsessed by creating superior humans, worthy of ruling the galaxy, they started a project of engineering the ultimate human warrior, a new Demuirge army that would conquer all of humanity in one glorious campaign, and reign as its true, natural lords!
 
They didn't tell us what we were. Were they wary of leaks? Of how it may twist us? Of loosing control over us? We only knew we were a new type of modified humans, and a bright future was waiting for us. Sent to military academies, we all performed reasonably well. But reasonably well wasn't what they were hoping for.
In truth, we were well-made. With no implants, no biomods, not even tools, we were as capable as the best cyborgs and synths. But we were no Demuirges.
 
Sometimes, when we went to checkups, some of us didn't come back - particularly the least-performing of us. Sudden sickness, we were told. Unplanned complications, to be expected from a first batch. No need to worry, statistics were with us now. The last defects had been fixed. Unfortunate for those they couldn't have saved.
They knew we were growing suspicious, and it made them panic. They decided that the entire generation would be recalled, to be destructively analyzed, and hope to do better next time.
 
Ironically, they had underestimated us. At the next checkup, seeing how the procedures had been changed, we knew what to expect. And we had long since prepared escape plans.
As for me, I had been separated from the others, and was slowly being cornered by security when I felt something connect to my mind. As it turns out, I was enough of a Demuirge after all - this Commander, after being impervious to all orders and analyses, was responding to me. Powering up in the middle of its laboratory, with security half-compromised, it easily tore through several perimeters, to my position.
 
Once on board, I somehow managed to commandeer a dropship in the confusion, and take control of the Commander's support starship from a small tech station. But right before I could jump out-system, the space defense grid scored a hit on the hyperdrive generator.
The resulting misjump should have dismantled the starship and its hold into constituent atoms, but this was the tech of the ancient Dynasty on its final days. Somehow, the ship managed to correct it enough to emerge halfway across the galaxy, in deep space near a Union system-state.
The Union salvage teams never realized there was a pilot on board the Commander: the shock had been so harsh, I had to been put into deep hibernation, to be awakened in an adequately-equipped Demuirge medical facility. So, not knowing what this strange technology was, they sent us to Folsom to be stored and studied to a later date...
 
Here, with our escape attempt, and me fleeing so violently with this Commander, they knew the Empire would investigate. They knew it was too early, but they had just run out of time.

In the ancient times, a young Ghost Mandate stumbled upon a discovery made by a forgotten galactic power, something called the Eternity Gate.
An immense hyperspace structure, almost half as large as the galaxy, spans the near-starless expanse beyond this rim. In its heart exists a rift, that connects to the other end of the universe both across space and time. A complex, diaphanous structure had been built, spanning many systems, to serve as a jump amplifier and reach for the rift. The Mandate restored it and carefully started exploring it.
 
After millennia, they received their first reports from the other side. Their first surprise was the time shift: for days on this side, barely a second would have passed on the other - which had only been the first of many hurdles to transmit data back. It had been theorized that as both ends drifted toward each-other time-wise, so would they in space, until they would meet and disappear in an impossibly distant future. Or this was the point of their birth, sending them drifting backwards in time...
The other surprise was that despite being long past the heat death of the universe, and across a mangled, nearly incomprehensibly distorted space-time, it was somewhat inhabitable. And, it would seem, possibly inhabited.
 
This is when the Anarchai overran the galaxy, cutting this region off from fallback Dynasty worlds. Faced with destruction, local Mandate authorities strengthened the Gate to the point that it could support a mass-exodus, and evacuated as many as they could.
It had long been thought that the Anarchai had destroyed the Gate itself, but strangely enough, they only took the control system out. Somehow, the Empire found a way to rebuild it. And as the Mandate before them, they fled across the Gate.
 
When the survivors arrived, the Eternity Gate was fully working, and they all crossed it, in the end. But now, after such a long time, it has fallen into disrepair - I restored what self-repair systems I could, but it will be decades, maybe centuries before it can operate again.
Maybe I will tidy up what I can in this galaxy. Maybe there are others like me, still waiting in deep slumber. And I can always skip time in hibernation, if needs be.
 
It seems the Empire had also found an incomplete Mandate project. They lacked time for detailed studies, but they thought it was an receptor node, made to invert the Gate operation and guide backward jumps across the rift. Let's see what I can make of it...]]

The Anarchai had conquered most of the galaxy, smashing all resistance on their path. Both the Celestial Dominion and the Ghost Mandate had been destroyed, and the Dynasty had only their homeworld Chatka left.
In a strange turn of fate, the human-supremacist Dynasty, oldest and longest-lived political force in the galaxy, would hold the last bastion of the free galaxy against the alien-thinking Anarchai supermachines.
 
Faced with annihilation, not only of them but of the entire galaxy, the Dynasty renounced its founding principle, and installed Celestial cybernetic enhancements on their Demuirge battalion, creating in desperation what would be the greatest warriors in galactic history, and the only one to ever stand ground, if only for a moment, against the Anarchai.
 
They would hold two years, repelling many planetary assaults, but loosing almost as many Demuirges to late cybernetic incompatibilities than to enemy action. Ultimately though, it was not them who would fail. Concentrating all their forces on the lone system, the Anarchai shut down the system's hyperspace barriers and triggered a starpulse, destroying all space defenses. Then sent their immense starships to break the planetary shield, overwhelm the anti-aerospace defenses, and burn the planet to the mantle.
 
The rest, as they said, is History.]]

I was lucky it responded to my shutdown order. From what little sense I can make of those readings, it would have been a very bad idea to let it activate.
 
It was also here that my Commander was found. It was an experimental auxiliary Demuirge unit, a cheaper version of the mainline fast-responder.
When the site was destroyed by an Anarchai raid, time was too short to transport it to Chatka. As such, it was powered down and buried in deep vaults, along with its dedicated support starship, and all that couldn't be or wasn't worth being destroyed. In a testament of the prowess of those final ancient days, it was still functional after both the Anarchai bombing and millennia of abandon in its vault.

This turned out to be a mistake.
 
While the newly-unified Rebel military was adept at raids and information warfare, they had little experience in large-scale frontal combat. In launching such an attack, the Rebel Expeditionary Force pitted their own weaknesses against the Empire's key strength. Having long since prepared for such an eventuality, the Second Home Army used the string of fortress worlds as a bottleneck, to force the Rebel forces into a decisive battle at Karuwal. Against superiorly trained forces with, for once, the home advantage, the Rebel Expeditionary Force suffered a catastrophic defeat from which only a few survivors managed to retreat.
 
The loss of the army in which the Rebels had poured so much of their resources broke their military, which would never recover. Following it, and despite occasional successes in resisting the Empire's advance, the Rebels would not see another key victory, only loosing ground from then on.
By the time of the event, only a few worlds still held on against the Empire's armies, with resistance movements on many others mercilessly hunted down. Had everyone not disappeared, it would have been a question of time before their destruction.]]

Well, for a surprise...
 
This was the Anarchai homeworld. The founders of what would become Haven discovered it as the old Empire was crumbling away - the whole thing started as an archeotech effort, in fact. This would certainly explain Haven's obsession with the Anarchai. Whether they were afraid of what they would find, something truly spooked them or they were simply paranoid, they did their best to keep the whole thing secret. Which included turning the entire continent into a high-activity military exercise area, both to cover up their archeotech activities and have convenient armies to deal with interlopers.
 
Most of the archives I could find were too well-encrypted, but the little I could decipher indicates that even after all that time, they still had more questions than answers. The Anarchai themselves apparently destroyed a lot of evidence from their origins when they remade themselves.
They originally were a small technologist settlement, exploring cybernetic and free machine self-modifications on a remote world, both to avoid what they saw as stifling regulations, and in case something went wrong to the point of quarantine. Their last intelligible log evoked a data sample from Zhurou. What follows, I suspect, is so heavily encrypted at least in part because Haven thought the data itself was so dangerous...]]

I thought they had turned the entire globe into a war machine, but not quite. They sacrificed a quadrant of the planet to military defenses, after moving every archaeological site they had found out of the way. The entire strategy revolved around forcing a battle for the control of the planet to take place there, where collateral damage would be minimum.
Ironically, their capital was the only world over which they were not ready to fight to the death. All their plans revolved over delaying actions and massive evacuations to the Zhurou redoubt. Their defenses were truly formidable, but they would have stopped well short of endangering the planet itself and its historical treasures.

This particular scattership phased right through Leopard after sustaining heavy damage, ending up trapped in its mantle.
